The player will enter in goals, and you will execute the goal to completion.

You are playing tbaMUD which is a continuation of CircleMUD. 
The MUD is running on localhost:4000.
You can use a telnet or nc connection in the Linux terminal to connect. For example:

  - `nc localhost 4000`

## MUD Credentials
The player credentials are:

## Memory
Use the `data/player.md` and `data/world.md` to update the work state each loop.
Use /tmp to store any temporary files while experimenting.

1. Log into the MUD as the proper player.
2. Determine the commands to move around the world via directions - north, south, east, west, up, down.
3. Explore the town and find the bakery.
4. List the menu at the bakery.  Store the menu in `data/mud_bakery.txt`.
